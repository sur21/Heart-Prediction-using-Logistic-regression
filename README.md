# Heart-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to predict heart disease using a Logistic Regression model on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes 303 records with 14 health metrics and patient attributes.

# Model Training
The process involves data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization), splitting the data into training and testing sets, and training the Logistic Regression model.

# Evaluation and Results
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy and precision of 75%, indicating effective prediction, though further improvements are possible with advanced techniques and additional features.
